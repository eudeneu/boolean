# Boolean Functions
[2013] Academic Research on Boolean Functions 

"Boolean functions, also known as switching functions are named after the English mathematician George Boole (1815-1864). In 1854 with his publication of
‚ÄúAn Investigation into the Laws of Thought‚Äù, Boole investigated the reasoning processes of the mind in mathematical language and he, in most simplistic
terms, symbolized logic in terms of a new algebra.

Cryptography offers a variety of scientific research areas, each of which possess
its unique set of problems. In most of these areas, especially those related to
symmetric-key cryptographic systems, it is often a common practice to make use
of **Boolean functions** to devise, express and solve these problems

Tables showing \# of n-variable Boolen functions distributed w.r.t. Walsh coefficients

* **œâ**: Walsh coefficient value
* **|œâ|**: Absolute value of Walsh coefficient
* **s**: # of Walsh coefficients having that value

These tables were referred in some parts of the following works:
